# Goblin Tower Defence

A tower defence game built in Unity with a goblin theme.
This was my first complete Unity project where I experimented with enemy AI, wave systems, and towers with unique abilities.

- Build towers to defend against waves of goblins.
- Towers have special abilities and upgrade trees (laser ramping damage, radius explosions, etc.).
- Wave system with scaling difficulty.
- Fun goblin theme with custom art.

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity 2D
- **Version Control:** Originally on Plastic SCM, switched to Git

# What I Learned
How to use object-oriented design (inheritance for enemies and towers).

Implementing a wave system and enemy pathfinding.

Managing project files with Unityâ€™s folder structure.

Save and load system working with multiple data types.

Lots of testing and bugfixing.

# Future Plans
Currently, the project is not under development, but I do have plans to revisit it in the future.
